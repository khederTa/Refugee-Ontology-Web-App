                    Refugeehood is a multidimensional phenomenon and a complex challenge facing the world today. To
                    equip policy-makers and civil organizations with knowledge tools that can improve their plans,
                    programs, and evaluation, we developed an ontology of refugeesâ€™ home return. Home return is a
                    sub-field of
                    refugee studies and one of the most elusive concepts. Modeling this sub-field, using the OntoClean
                    method,
                    helps us create a coherent whole, accounting for the complex relations between the various factors
                    that construct home return. In addition, the ontology rigorously defines and (re)constructs the
                    concepts
                    from the literature on home return, providing clarity and rigor for scholars of refugee studies. We
                    conclude with discussion of future plans to develop an online application that makes this ontology
                    friendly
                    for normal users.

                    The past decade has seen a significant increase in global refugee movements, largely due to
                    conflicts in the Middle East. This has resulted in a refugee crisis, particularly within the
                    European Union, causing political and social upheaval. This paper aims to develop an ontology to
                    improve the management of refugee-related issues, focusing on the concept of home return. Despite
                    extensive academic literature on refugees, practical application of this knowledge in governance
                    remains challenging. The proposed ontology aims to bridge this gap, providing a structured approach
                    to understanding and applying concepts from refugee studies. The methodology offers logical rigor
                    and facilitates knowledge organization and semantic search. The long-term goals include enabling
                    policy-makers to understand and apply concepts from the literature, and to upload real data to test
                    relations between various concepts and measure program impact. The paper focuses on the complex
                    issue of refugee home return, aiming to formally model this elusive field of knowledge.
